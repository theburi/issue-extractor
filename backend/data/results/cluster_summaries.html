      <td>The Camunda and Zeebe clusters are experiencing a multitude of issues, including inconsistent data retention and storage usage, performance problems with filters and report rendering, grpc timeouts, DNS resolution issues, and scaling challenges. Additionally, there are concerns around backup and restore processes, Elasticsearch cluster management, and Helm chart consistency. Furthermore, security vulnerabilities, such as secrets in clear text variables and incorrect redirects, pose a risk to the system. The clusters' performance is also impacted by high memory usage, disk latency issues, and network latency problems, leading to slow response times and potential data loss.</td>

      <td>It appears that you have a large list of issues related to deploying and configuring Camunda 8 on Azure. I'll provide a summary of the main categories and some potential next steps for each category.\n\n**Deployment Issues**\n\n* Camunda 8 pods not starting up correctly after deployment on Azure\n\t+ Potential solution: Check the container logs, verify that the dependencies are installed, and ensure that the Kubernetes cluster is configured correctly.\n* Camunda 8 installation failed due to missing chart dependencies\n\t+ Potential solution: Review the Helm charts used for deployment, update the dependencies, and try re-deploying.\n\n**Security and Authentication**\n\n* Camunda 8 not logging in users who do not have authorization to access (due to `security.auth.cookies.samesite.enabled=true`)\n\t+ Potential solution: Update the `samesite` configuration or implement an alternative authentication mechanism.\n* Single Sign-On (SSO) setup issue with Camunda and Okta\n\t+ Potential solution: Verify that the SSO configuration is correct, test the login process, and ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.\n\n**Performance and Scalability**\n\n* Performance issues with APIs in Camunda 8 deployment on Azure\n\t+ Potential solution: Optimize API endpoints, increase instance size or use a load balancer, and consider using caching mechanisms.\n* Deployment of a large DMN file with 100k rules and 3 columns exceeds the maximum upload size limit in Camunda 8 on Azure\n\t+ Potential solution: Split the large DMN file into smaller files, use a more efficient storage mechanism (e.g., Azure Blob Storage), or consider using a different deployment strategy.\n\n**Monitoring and Logging**\n\n* Camunda 8 process instance metrics not available in Prometheus\n\t+ Potential solution: Verify that the Prometheus configuration is correct, ensure that the necessary metrics are exposed by Camunda, and check for any issues with data ingestion.\n* Cannot find logs for processes running in Camunda where can these logs be found?\n\t+ Potential solution: Check the container logs, verify that the logging mechanism is configured correctly, and consider using a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack).\n\n**Identity and Authorization**\n\n* Difficulty in setting up identity in Camunda cluster on Azure\n\t+ Potential solution: Review the identity configuration, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed, and test the setup process.\n* Mapping existing users to their current profiles and handling SSO changes in Azure AD domain after migrating email addresses from health.govtnz to tewhatuoragovtnz\n\t+ Potential solution: Verify that the user mapping is correct, update the SSO configuration accordingly, and ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.\n\n**General Issues**\n\n* Camunda Platform and Zeebe are not stable after upgrading from Helm version 1004 to 1032\n\t+ Potential solution: Review the upgrade process, verify that all dependencies are updated, and test the stability of the platform.\n* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Backup not supporting Premium SSD v2 disks\n\t+ Potential solution: Check with Azure support for alternative backup solutions or consider upgrading to a different storage tier.\n\nTo further assist you, I would like to know:\n\n1. What is your current Camunda 8 deployment setup?\n2. Have you encountered any specific errors or logs that might help identify the issue?\n3. Are there any specific areas of concern or priority for you?\n\nPlease provide more information about your current setup and the issues you're facing, and I'll do my best to provide more tailored guidance.</td>
