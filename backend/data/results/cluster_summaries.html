      <td>It appears that you have a large list of error messages related to Camunda 8 deployment on Azure, OpenShift, and other environments. I'll provide a summary of the issues and categorize them for easier reference:\n\n**Deployment Issues**\n\n1. Helm chart version mismatch (e.g., 1010 or later fails to create a PostgreSQL secret)\n2. Incorrect registry settings for Keycloak and PostgreSQL images\n3. Misinterpretation of `webmodelerrestapiexternaldatabaseenabled` value leading to incorrect configuration of the `springdatasourcepassword` secret\n\n**Security Vulnerabilities**\n\n1. Kubernetes deployment fails due to security vulnerability (specifically, readonlyrootfilesystem option not set at pod level)\n2. Inability to access Camunda console due to object conversion errors in clusters and management clusters after entering username and password\n3. Permissions issues after restoring Camunda 8 on Azure\n\n**Performance Issues**\n\n1. Slow performance of Camunda 8 process instances in Azure environment due to large data in OpenSearch indices\n2. Multitenancy issues with Camunda 8315, causing performance problems and pause periods in processing of all started instances\n\n**Networking Issues**\n\n1. Intermittent network timeout between Camunda Gateway and Brokers in a three-node OpenShift cluster\n2. Inability to access Camunda application with TLS termination on ingress, despite having intracluster TLS installed via Helm chart\n\n**Data Consistency Issues**\n\n1. Elasticsearch data volumes being replaced during deployment, resulting in loss of historical data and subsequent errors when fetching data from Elasticsearch\n2. Camunda Operate index issues and data inconsistencies after initial bug fix\n3. Camunda Operate batch size was set to 10, causing it to become smaller after re-importing data into Elasticsearch\n\n**Authentication Issues**\n\n1. Difficulty with activating Camunda license\n2. Inability to connect to Keycloak instance running in the same Kubernetes cluster and namespace (Camunda Identity)\n\n**Other Issues**\n\n1. Helm chart installation and deployment issues on Azure\n2. Absolute paths defined in Camunda 8 Helm chart causing issues with URL access to applications\n3. Integration issue between Camunda and OpenSearch, specifically with Tasklist data not being imported correctly\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be additional issues not mentioned here. It's recommended to review the error messages and investigate each issue individually to determine the root cause and implement a solution.</td>

      <td>The Camunda platform is experiencing a multitude of issues, primarily related to authentication, authorization, and connectivity problems. These issues stem from incorrect or missing configuration settings, such as invalid certificates, expired client secrets, and misconfigured connectors. Additionally, problems with token validation, authorization, and caching are causing errors in various applications, including WebModeler, TaskList, and Operate. Furthermore, issues with Keycloak authentication, such as redirect loops and 403 Forbidden errors, are hindering access to the platform. These problems require immediate attention to ensure seamless functionality and user experience.</td>

      <td>The integration of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Camunda is plagued by numerous issues, including authentication problems, configuration errors, and compatibility issues with various components such as Zeebe, Operate, and WebModeler. Additionally, there are concerns about multitenancy, identity provider connections, and backup functionality, leading to potential downtime and security risks for end-users. Furthermore, the lack of clear guidance on implementing OpenID Connect and Azure AD groups integration hinders effective identity management.</td>

      <td>It appears that you have provided a large list of error messages related to Zeebe, a distributed transactional system. I'll provide a summary and categorization of the errors to help identify potential issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe errors can be broadly categorized into:\n\n1. **Deployment and Configuration Issues**\n\t* Harbor artifact download issues\n\t* Insufficient configuration for Zeebe Gateway and Prometheus monitoring\n\t* Inconsistent sizing and configuration of Zeebe components\n2. **Authentication and Authorization Issues**\n\t* Authentication issue with Zeebe Gateway when using GRPC API\n\t* Community client authentication issue with Zeebe Gateway\n\t* Denying call to Zeebe Gateway due to 'authorized tenants could not be retrieved from identity' error\n3. **Connection and Communication Issues**\n\t* Connection issues between Zeebe Gateway and Broker causing tasks to fail\n\t* 504 Gateway Timeout Errors and Job Streaming Issues with Zeebe Engine in Kubernetes\n4. **Performance and Scalability Issues**\n\t* Uneven leader distribution in Zeebe cluster causing leadership election process issues\n\t* High network latency between Zeebe brokers and gateways causing Atomix membership sync timeouts\n5. **Security and Compliance Issues**\n\t* Zeebe does not support NFS (Network File System) and using AWS EFS with NFS can cause data corruption, leading to corrupted Zeebe instance\n6. **Operate and Tasklist Issues**\n\t* Operate cannot connect to Zeebe despite Zeebe and Zeebe Gateway being able to communicate with each other\n\t* Difficulty in adding a custom certificate to Zeebe\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Review the deployment and configuration of Zeebe components to ensure consistency and correctness.\n2. Investigate authentication and authorization issues, such as verifying the identity of authorized tenants and ensuring proper GRPC API configuration.\n3. Analyze connection and communication issues, including checking for network latency and ensuring proper broker-Zeebe Gateway communication.\n4. Optimize performance and scalability by addressing uneven leader distribution and high network latency.\n5. Ensure security and compliance by avoiding NFS with AWS EFS and properly configuring custom certificates.\n6. Troubleshoot Operate and Tasklist issues, such as verifying the connection to Zeebe and ensuring proper configuration.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. Review the error messages and identify the most critical issues.\n2. Investigate each issue in detail, using tools such as logs, network traffic analysis, and performance monitoring.\n3. Develop a plan to address each issue, including any necessary changes to deployment, configuration, authentication, or security settings.\n4. Implement the fixes and verify that the issues are resolved.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to help with anything specific or provide more detailed guidance on addressing these issues.</td>
