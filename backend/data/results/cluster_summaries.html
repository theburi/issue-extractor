      <td>It appears you've listed a large number of issues related to deploying and using Camunda 8 on various platforms (Azure, Kubernetes, Helm charts, etc.). I'll provide a summary of the categories and some potential next steps for each:\n\n**Deployment Issues**\n\n1. **Helm chart configuration**: Some Helm charts have incorrect or missing configurations, leading to deployment failures.\n2. **Image registry issues**: Incorrect registry settings cause issues with deploying images from separate charts (e.g., Elasticsearch, Keycloak).\n3. **Ingress not setting SNI extensions**: Ingress configuration is incomplete, causing invalid SNI errors when accessing Camunda Optimize with TLS.\n\n**Authentication and Authorization**\n\n1. **Keycloak authentication failures**: Duplicate global identity auth component client IDs and existing secrets cause issues.\n2. **TLS configuration issues**: Camunda Identity component not working correctly with TLS configuration.\n3. **Identity component not connecting to Keycloak**: Issues with connecting to Keycloak, causing authentication failures.\n\n**Performance and Data Loss**\n\n1. **Slow performance of Camunda Operate**: Long-running process instances with Kafka as the start event cause slow performance.\n2. **Loss of historical data**: Camunda Operate unable to fetch data from Elasticsearch after a recent deployment that replaced existing data volumes.\n3. **Backup API issues**: Camunda 8 backup API not creating the 6th part of a backup.\n\n**Kubernetes and Helm**\n\n1. **Duplicate env variable or order issue**: Duplicate env variables or incorrect order during Helm upgrade cause issues.\n2. **Absolute paths causing URL access issues**: Absolute paths defined in Camunda Helm charts cause issues with URL access to the application.\n\n**Other Issues**\n\n1. **Zeebe client authentication issues**: Zeebe client authentication issues with Camunda 8.2x on Azure.\n2. **Camunda ES deployment failures**: Security vulnerability causes deployment failure of Elasticsearch pod.\n3. **WebModeler WebSockets pod fails to start**: Permission denied error when trying to create a variable in the WebModeler WebSockets pod.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1. Review and update Helm chart configurations to ensure correct settings.\n2. Verify image registry settings and update them if necessary.\n3. Investigate and resolve issues with Keycloak authentication and TLS configuration.\n4. Optimize Camunda Operate performance for long-running process instances.\n5. Resolve backup API issues and ensure data is not lost.\n6. Review Kubernetes and Helm configurations to prevent duplicate env variables or incorrect order.\n7. Address Zeebe client authentication issues, Camunda ES deployment failures, and WebModeler WebSockets pod fails to start.\n\nPlease note that this summary is not exhaustive, and some issues might be missing. It's essential to review the original list and prioritize the most critical issues for your specific use case.</td>

      <td>It appears that you have a large list of errors and issues related to Camunda Platform, an open-source workflow and business process management platform. I'll provide a summary of the main categories and some potential next steps:\n\n**General Issues**\n\n* Many errors are related to Elasticsearch, including index creation errors, corrupted indices, and performance issues.\n* Some errors are related to PostgreSQL storage issues, such as PVC filling up after increasing storage size.\n* There are also issues with Helm charts, including incorrect configuration and values file formatting.\n\n**Elasticsearch-Specific Issues**\n\n* Index lifecycle management (ILM) policy not configured correctly\n* Elasticsearch cluster crashes after 10 minutes or so\n* Uneven leader distribution causing election leader change and subsequent back pressure\n* Large optimize index size and potential impact on Elasticsearch performance\n\n**PostgreSQL Storage Issues**\n\n* PVC filling up after increasing storage size\n* PostgreSQL storage issue causing data loss or corruption\n\n**Helm Chart Issues**\n\n* Incorrect configuration and values file formatting\n* Helm chart not using consistent user ID for components, causing potential issues with file permissions and storage classes\n\n**Performance and Experience**\n\n* Performance issues with filters on variables and nested documents in Camunda Optimize\n* Slow process execution times despite connection timeout settings\n* High memory footprint of Elasticsearch components in the environment\n\n**Deployment and Upgrade Issues**\n\n* Failed upgrade from Docker 81 to Kubernetes 83/85, resulting in corrupted state and loss of historical data\n* Duplicate process instances created when using asynchronous workflow creation with 'withResult' option\n* Operate backup process times out after reaching part 5 of 6, resulting in incomplete state\n\n**Security and Authentication**\n\n* Multitenancy issue with C library\n* Unable to find parent tree path for flow node instance id or unable to find parent instance id\n* Invalid aggregation name exception when using outliers in optimization\n\nTo address these issues, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Review and update Elasticsearch configuration and ILM policy.\n2. Investigate and resolve PostgreSQL storage issues.\n3. Review and correct Helm chart configuration and values file formatting.\n4. Perform a thorough review of performance and experience issues.\n5. Plan and execute a successful upgrade from Docker 81 to Kubernetes 83/85.\n6. Address multitenancy issue with C library and ensure secure authentication mechanisms are in place.\n\nIt's also recommended to:\n\n* Create a detailed error log and tracking system to monitor progress and identify root causes of issues.\n* Establish a regular maintenance and update schedule for Camunda Platform.\n* Provide clear documentation and guidance on deployment, upgrade, and configuration best practices.</td>
